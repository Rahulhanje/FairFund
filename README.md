# FairFund

FairFund is a transparent blockchain-based aid distribution system designed specifically for small farmers. It implements a farmer-initiated model that allows farmers to request aid directly, enabling donors to contribute to specific farming projects in a transparent and accountable way.

## Overview

FairFund bridges the gap between donors and small-scale farmers, creating a decentralized platform that:

- Enables farmers to directly request financial assistance for specific agricultural needs
- Allows donors to contribute directly to verified farmers' projects
- Provides transparency in the flow of funds from donors to beneficiaries
- Builds reputation and trust through a verification system
- Tracks donation history and successful disbursements

## Features

### For Farmers
- **Self-registration**: Farmers can register with their details including location and farm type
- **Aid requests**: Create specific funding requests with detailed purposes and amounts
- **Verification**: Get verified by the platform to build trust with donors
- **Direct fund receipt**: Receive funds directly to their wallet once approved

### For Donors
- **Registration**: Create a profile with name and description
- **Transparent giving**: View all aid requests and choose which projects to fund
- **Reputation system**: Build reputation through consistent, successful disbursements
- **Verification**: Get verified to enhance trust with farmers and other stakeholders

### For Platform Administrators
- **Verification management**: Verify both farmers and donors to ensure authenticity
- **Statistics tracking**: Access comprehensive statistics on platform usage
- **Transparency**: All transactions and activities are recorded on the blockchain

## Technical Details

FairFund is built on Ethereum using Solidity version 0.8.17. It implements the following main components:

- Structs for Donors, Farmers, and AidRequests
- Comprehensive mapping and tracking systems for all participants
- Event emissions for key actions to enable front-end notifications
- Role-based permission system with owner, donor, and farmer modifiers
- View functions to access aggregated statistics and individual profiles

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for deployment
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or similar Ethereum wallet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahulhanje/FairFund.git
   cd fairfund
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contract:
   ```bash
   # Using Truffle
   truffle compile
   
   # Using Hardhat
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy to a test network:
   ```bash
   # Using Truffle
   truffle migrate --network goerli
   
   # Using Hardhat
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
   ```

## Usage

### For Farmers

#### Register as a Farmer
```javascript
await fairFund.registerFarmer(
  "John Doe",           // Name
  "Nairobi, Kenya",     // Location
  "Organic Vegetables"  // Farm type
);
```

#### Request Aid
```javascript
await fairFund.requestAid(
  "Irrigation System",             // Request name
  "Installing drip irrigation",    // Purpose
  ethers.utils.parseEther("0.5")   // Amount (in ETH)
);
```

### For Donors

#### Register as a Donor
```javascript
await fairFund.registerDonor(
  "ABC Foundation",                // Name
  "Supporting sustainable farming" // Description
);
```

#### Fund an Aid Request
```javascript
await fairFund.fundAidRequest(
  1,  // Request ID
  { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.5") }  // Amount to fund
);
```

### For Administrators

#### Verify a Farmer
```javascript
await fairFund.verifyFarmer("0x123..."); // Farmer's address
```

#### Verify a Donor
```javascript
await fairFund.verifyDonor("0x456..."); // Donor's address
```

#### Get Contract Statistics
```javascript
const stats = await fairFund.getContractStats();
console.log(`Total Donors: ${stats._totalDonors}`);
console.log(`Total Beneficiaries: ${stats._totalBeneficiaries}`);
console.log(`Total Funds Distributed: ${stats._totalFundsDistributed}`);
```

## View Functions

### Get All Aid Requests
```javascript
const requests = await fairFund.getAllAidRequests();
// Returns arrays of request details including IDs, farmer addresses, etc.
```

### Get All Farmers
```javascript
const farmers = await fairFund.getAllFarmers();
// Returns arrays of farmer details including addresses, names, locations, etc.
```

### Get All Donors
```javascript
const donors = await fairFund.getAllDonors();
// Returns arrays of donor details including addresses, names, descriptions, etc.
```

## Events

The contract emits the following events that can be listened to:

- `DonorRegistered`: When a new donor registers
- `FarmerRegistered`: When a new farmer registers
- `AidRequested`: When a farmer creates a new aid request
- `AidFunded`: When a donor funds an aid request
- `DonorVerified`: When an administrator verifies a donor
- `FarmerVerified`: When an administrator verifies a farmer
- `ReputationUpdated`: When a donor's reputation score is updated

## Security Considerations

- The contract implements access controls using modifiers
- Verification system reduces the risk of fraudulent requests
- Reputation system helps identify reliable donors
- Direct fund transfers minimize intermediaries
- Consider additional security audits before mainnet deployment

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-signature approvals for large aid requests
- Integration with oracle services for farm verification
- Support for non-ETH stablecoins
- Enhanced reputation algorithms
- Governance mechanisms for community-led decisions
