# FairFund Smart Contract

## Project Overview

This project deploys a FairFund smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.  The contract manages a fund, likely distributing funds fairly amongst participants based on predefined rules or algorithms.  The project utilizes Hardhat for development and testing.

## Features

* **FairFund Smart Contract:** A Solidity smart contract (`contracts/fairfund.sol`) implementing a fair fund distribution mechanism.
* **Lock Smart Contract:** A supplementary Solidity smart contract (`contracts/Lock.sol`) potentially used for controlling access or locking funds within the FairFund contract.
* **Hardhat Integration:** Uses Hardhat (`hardhat.config.js`) for compilation, deployment, and testing of smart contracts.
* **Deployment Script:** A JavaScript deployment script (`scripts/deploy.js`) automates the contract deployment process.
* **Javascript Frontend Modules:** Javascript modules in `ignition/modules/` likely interact with the deployed smart contract.  `fairfund.js` is likely the main module for interacting with the FairFund contract, 
* **Testing Framework:**  JavaScript unit tests for the FairFund contract (`test/fairfund.js`).




## Usage

1. **Compile Contracts:** `npx hardhat compile`
2. **Deploy Contracts:** `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`  (You will likely need to configure network settings in `hardhat.config.js` before deploying).
3. **Run Tests:** `npx hardhat test`
4. **Interact with Contracts (Frontend):** Instructions for using the Javascript frontend modules in `ignition/modules` are not provided in the directory structure.  Further documentation will be needed to explain the usage of `fairfund.js` and `Lock.js`.
